# üê≥ Willy Slack Bot

Inspired by [Lowkin's ChatGPT Slackbot](https://github.com/lokwkin/chatgpt-slackbot-node/tree/main)

This service is docker containerized, and incorporates a queue mechanism with redis, so that it is more flexible to handle request spikes.

## üü¢ Usage

- The slackbot will listen to two types of event in slack workspace
  - Directly message the bot in slack.
  - Mention your bot in a channel with a question.
- To ask follow up question, reply in the answer thread, otherwise it will treat it as a new question.

## üè≥Ô∏è Start Modes

This app has two modes to start:

1. `slackbot` - listens to slack event for user requests, put request to redis queue, reply to slack on answer received.
2. `willy` - serves as queue worker that listens to queue, forward user's questions to willy, and put response back to queue on answer received.

### üí¨ Slack Setup

1. Register an Slack App in [portal](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. "Socket Mode" -> Enable Socket Mode
3. "OAuth & Permissions" -> Grant these permissions: `app_mentions:read`, `channels:history`, `chat:write`, `im:history`, `im:write`, `reactions:write`, `groups:history`
4. "Event Subscription" -> "Subscribe to bot events" -> Add `message.im` and `app_mention`
5. "App Home" -> "Message Tab" -> Check "Allow users to send Slash commands and messages from the messages tab"
6. Obtain your Bot Token from "OAuth & Permissions" > "Bot User OAuth Token"
7. Obtain your App Token from "Basic Information" > "App Level Token"
8. "Install App" -> Reinstall to workspace if neccessary
